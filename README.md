# BusinessBoardSimulation

It is a simulation of a board game , I used to play when I was a kid. 

The game goes like:
We buy cities, make rents, build houses, and make more rents...and so on..

It is usually a never-ending game.
But, it is considered to be finished, when one of the players is completely bankrupt and owes debt to all.
